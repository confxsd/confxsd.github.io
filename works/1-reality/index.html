        <p style="user-select: none;">Reality is perceived as subjective and constructed through language, power, and
            culture. It is fragmented, decentered, and deconstructed, lacking a single overarching narrative or absolute
            truth. Reality is seen as multiple, contingent, and constantly changing, reflecting the multiple
            perspectives, experiences, and power relations of individuals and groups in society. In postmodern art,
            reality is often portrayed as unstable, ambiguous, and playfully self-referential, blurring the boundaries
            between art, reality, and representation.</p>
